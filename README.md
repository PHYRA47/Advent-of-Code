# 🎄 Advent of Code 2023 🎅

Welcome to the final assignment for the Algorithm course in the [PSRS](https://www.master-photonics4security.eu/) 2023 program! This repository contains Python solutions to 12 selected problems from the 2023 [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenge by Eric Wastl. All functions are annotated with their time complexity.

## 🕰️ Time Complexity Annotations

- The time complexity of each function and operation is annotated within the code.
- If the function takes more than polynomial time, there is a discussion in the comments about whether the problem it solves is in NP.
